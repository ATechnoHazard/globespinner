# GlobeSpinner
ChatOps bot to deploy cloud resources with ease.

## Running the bot
This bot module is fully compatible with the standard Zulip bot modules. To run, clone this into the ```bots``` directory of the zulip-python-api, and follow the instructions provided at https://zulipchat.com/api/writing-bots to run it successfully.

## Why isn't a deployed instance available?
Deployed instances have access to extremely sensitive keys that allow access to my AWS, GCP and DigitalOcean accounts. I don't want anyone abusing the usage of the bot and racking up millions in fees.
